"Housing and rent affordability has over the years become a center point of concern for residents of San Diego. We are interested in learning the dynamics and influences that the implementation of public transit across neighborhoods of San Diego has on housing and rent affordability. Housing and transportation are on record for being the two largest household expenses according to the California Department of Housing and Community Development, placing both household expenses as factors that directly contribute to cost of living.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Rent is an expense that causes financial strain among many residents in a city. A previous group project, Airbnb-Group058 Final Project, approached a similar problem as they were tasked with analyzing rentals and creating predictive models to predict Airbnb rental pricing in San Diego. The group project concluded with creating a successful predictive model that could help predict prices in specified listings.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Our project primarily focuses on general rental in San Diego rather than solely Airbnb, but what was learned through this previous group project is that rental datasets can be integrated into predictive models to pretend trends of rental prices in the city of San Diego. \n",
    "\n",
"Our project seeks to analyze the correlations between the spatial distances from public transit and the costs of rent in the neighborhoods of San Diego. The City of San Diego's Metropolitan Transit System has almost 100 fixed bus routes in operation, including urban, local, and rural routes.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) It also contains a light rail service that is operated by the SDTI system consisting of five separate lines, UC San Diego Blue, Green, Orange, Silver and Copper lines with a total 65 miles of rail across 62 stations <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)This allows public transit to provide improvements in general commuting among the city. However, residents who do happen to live near transit are notably lower-income, and are experiencing the rise of costs in these areas as they increasingly become less affordable. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) The rental market trends in San Diego estimate that as a whole, the average rent for an apartment is around $2,296-$3,699 in 2025<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) \n",
    "\n",
"We are taking into consideration whether higher demand for housing near transit areas could potentially be the reason many individuals could find themselves priced out from areas with high amounts of accessible public transportation. A similar study was done analyzing the role of accessibility to buses in determining housing prices in Xiamen China that developed spatial econometric models that helped estimate global and local relationships between bus accessibility and housing prices.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) This study specifically focuses on whether there is an effect on property price and value through bus accessibility. The study findings suggest that accessibility to buses does positively affect nearby property prices, making them more high in demand, bus travel time to city centers and bus frequency also were found to have a significant effect on property prices.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)  This study suggests that there is a potential cost effect in city areas that contain accessible public transit. Another similar research analysis focused on how the proximity to transport affects the property value in San Diego, and how the transit-oriented development had a large effect on San Diego's real estate market.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) The research found that studies show properties that are near high-capacity transit lines experience a transit premium of up to 150%, concluding that investors and buyers should consider the proximity to public transit when making investment decisions.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) These findings help create a strong argument for  a general correlation between public transit and the fluctuation of housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
"Overall, our project is primarily focused on the correlation between rent prices and proximity to public transit. However, the previous work and research allows for us to lay the foundation of the direct correlation between the housing and rental markets and public transit.\n",

    "There should be no major ethical concerns regarding this project. Since we are collecting public data regarding prices of homes and distance from public transport, there should be no privacy concerns. There are two biases however, one being that tenants would mostly consist of middle/lower class people as its unlikely upper class people would be near public transport locations. This bias would work in our favor as the prices of rich homes would be a likely outlier, skweing our results. The other bias is that we are not including individual rental agreements as we are not easily able to access that kind of information. Without proper wording and clear communication of what we are reasearching, we could give a false sense of the prices of rent, which could lead to landlords taking advantage and raising rent with this reasearch as evidence. The way we will combat this potential issue is word our paper very explicitly about what we are measuring in this project. Finally, we will account for different levels of house quality by comparing houses of similar quality.",
