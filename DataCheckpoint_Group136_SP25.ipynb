    "Housing and rent affordability has over the years become a common center point of concern for residents of San Diego. We are interested in learning the dynamics and influences that the implementation of public transit across neighborhoods of San Diego has on housing and rent affordability. Housing and transportation are on record for being the two largest household expenses according to the California Department of Housing and Community Development, placing both household expenses as factors that directly contribute to cost of living.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) A previous group project, Airbnb-Group058 Final Project, approached a similar problem as they were tasked with analyzing rentals and creating predictive models to predict Airbnb rental pricing in San Diego. The group project concluded with creating a successful predictive model that could help predict prices in specified listings.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Our project primarily focuses on general rental in San Diego rather than solely Airbnb, and we can implement an idea from previous group project and integrate rental datasets into predictive models to predict trends of rental prices in the city of San Diego. \n",

    "Our project seeks to analyze the correlations between the spatial distances from public transit and the costs of rent in the neighborhoods of San Diego. The City of San Diego's Metropolitan Transit System has almost 100 fixed bus routes in operation, including urban, local, and rural routes.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) It also contains a light rail service that is operated by the SDTI system consisting of five separate lines, UC San Diego Blue, Green, Orange, Silver and Copper lines with a total 65 miles of rail across 62 stations <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)This allows public transit to provide improvements in general commuting among the city. The rental market trends in San Diego estimate that as a whole, the average rent for an apartment is around $2,296-$3,699 in 2025<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) \n",

    "We are taking into consideration whether higher demand for housing near transit areas could potentially be the reason many individuals could find themselves priced out from areas with high amounts of accessible public transportation. A similar study was done analyzing the role of accessibility to buses in determining housing prices in Xiamen China that developed spatial econometric models that helped estimate global and local relationships between bus accessibility and housing prices.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) This study specifically focuses on whether there is an effect on property price and value through bus accessibility. The study findings suggest that accessibility to buses does positively affect nearby property prices, making them more high in demand, bus travel time to city centers and bus frequency also were found to have a significant effect on property prices.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)  This study suggests that there is a potential cost effect in city areas that contain accessible public transit. Another similar research analysis focused on how the proximity to transport affects the property value in Santa Clara, and how the transit-oriented development had a large effect on Santa Clara's real estate market.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) The research found that residential parcel to jobs--both over highway and transit networks--increased land values, concluding that investors and buyers should consider the proximity to public transit when making investment decisions.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) These findings help create a strong argument for a general correlation between public transit and the fluctuation of housing prices.\n",

    "We predict that there is a negative correlation between the distance from a public transport and the cost of rent/a house. This is because we believe that easy access to public transport adds value to a residential location and would thus increase the cost of renting or buying a house. We hypothesize that transit access is considered a valuable addition and a cost-increasing amenity since it provides benefits of access to the main city and other parts of town outside of driving. However, we do maintain realistic concerns about potential confounds between areas with significant access to public transit and its implications for economic success, population density and similar variables. That is why we have taken the approach of a time-series evaluation of the data as well.\n",

    "Now in the ZHVI Dataset, observations for particular neighborhoods did not start until a particular date. Therefore, it is important to find out incomplete data when observations are missing after the start date. Furthermore, while removing neighborhoods with insufficient data is important at this step, we will enact a decision rule which ensures that only neighborhoods with lesser than 1 observation for every 3 months within a year are removed. This ensures that while data might revert to a more granular time level, it is still on par with the granularity of the transit data which is based on a year-by-year basis while still ensuring that any further San Diego-specific seasonal smoothing can be done on the ZHVI of neighborhoods."

    "Ethical concerns that may arise in this project are inferential privacy concerns, since we are collecting public data regarding prices of homes and distance from public transit there would not be directly identifiable information pertaining to specific individuals. However, this data can infer an individual's socioeconomic status and can help infer commuting patterns through accessible neighborhood locations and transit information. There is also bias presented here, one being that tenants would mostly consist of middle/lower class people as it's unlikely upper class people would be near public transport locations. This bias would work in our favor as the prices of rich homes would be a likely outlier, skewing our results. The other bias is that we are not including individual rental agreements as we are not easily able to access that kind of information. The data could lead to socioeconomic inequalities as certain neighborhood areas may experience price discrimination due to their neighborhoods having been interpreted as areas of either high or low property value. Without proper wording and clear communication of what we are researching, we could give a false sense of the prices of rent, which could lead to landlords taking advantage and raising rent with this research as evidence.Our project’s data interpretation could therefore reinforce gentrification practices as areas with rapid notable development would lead to rising rent and cause displacement of residents that are of lower income backgrounds. The way we will combat this potential issue is word our paper very explicitly about what we are measuring in this project.  We will be providing full transparency and fairness when interpreting our data, as well as recognizing its limitations. Our project will demonstrate responsibility and accountability with data usage and interpretation. We will ensure our data is an accurate representation of the city’s housing and public transit information and environment. Finally, we will account for different levels of house quality by comparing houses of similar quality.\n",
